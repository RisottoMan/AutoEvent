### How to change language?
- Write command ``ev language list`` to find your language.
- Write command ``ev language load [name]`` to load translation, for example, ``ev language load english``.
- The translation will replace the old one. You must wait for the server to restart completely.

### If my language is not on the list?
- You can create a translation and add your language to the repository.

### I found a mistake in the translation, what can I do?
- Go to the selected translation and correct it. We will include the change in the latest release.
