## 2) I only have one mini-game. What should I do?

- You haven't installed MapEditorReborn, so you have mini-games that won't need the maps.
- Install the MapEditorReborn plugin so that the plugin can load maps: [(Github MapEditorReborn)](https://github.com/Michal78900/MapEditorReborn/releases/latest)

## 3) MapEditorReborn was not detected. AutoEvent will not be loaded until you install MapEditorReborn.

## 4) You have installed the old version of 'MapEditorReborn' and cannot run this mini-game
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e66573f4-1899-43a7-9724-01d3c9cd97ec)
- It says what it means. You have an old version of MapEditorReborn. There are new features or a new version of SCP has been released. Therefore, errors appear.
- Install the new version of MapEditorReborn so that the plugin can load schematics: [(Github MapEditorReborn)](https://github.com/Michal78900/MapEditorReborn/releases/latest)

## 5) You need to download the map (something) to run this mini-game.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a71fb4f-08b3-4411-a693-25ac9aae26f6)
- It says what it means. This map is not exist on your server, so the mini-game cannot be run.
- You need to download *``Schematics.tar.gz``* from the [latest release](https://github.com/RisottoMan/AutoEvent/releases/latest).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/469eab25-2f94-4414-87dc-7402a5068aaf)
- Unzip *``Schematics.tar.gz``* to ``EXILED/Configs/AutoEvent/Schematics`` folder.

## 6) If you start a mini-game and appear on the map, but something is wrong.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/934b43a1-8802-48be-9c95-b84fe25103b9)
- If earlier errors referred to the fact that you did not install something correctly and all responsibility lay with you as a plugin user, now this error refers to me as a plugin developer.
- Write to the issue detailing the problem:

- I will fix the problem as soon as I find some free time.

## Enabling Debug Mode (debug-output.log): 
Autoevent has 2 methods of logging debug outputs. By default neither modes of logging are on. They can be enabled with their respective config options.
- Method 1 - Console logging (`debug`):
   - Console logging logs all errors to the console directly.
- Method 2 - Debug File Logging (`auto_log_debug`):
   - Debug file logging stores all errors to a debug file in the base autoevent directory. 
     - For NWApi: `~/.config/SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/plugins/global/AutoEvent/debug-output.log`
     - For Exiled: `~/.config/EXILED/Configs/AutoEvent/debug-output.log`
